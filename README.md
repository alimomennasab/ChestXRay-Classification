# ChestXRay-Classification

## Background

This repository contains the files to various CNN architectures that have been trained with the popular [Kaggle Chest X-Ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) to determine whether a medical photograph of the lungs of a patient contain pneumonia, or are healthy.

## Results
The model that performed best for this classification task (pneumonia or healthy) was ResNeXt-152 (~92.9% accuracy). The model that performed the worst was EfficientNet-B0 (~59.3% accuracy).
